Tired of bringing a notebook to the gym to record your workouts? Or worse...using your memory to recall your workouts after the fact?! 

If so, Stay Sweaty is designed for you. This app provides a simple, minimalistic way to keep track of your daily fitness routine. Upon logging in, you'll immediately be able to access a log of your previous workouts, and can view the details with a simple click.

### Instructions: 

To get started, simply login from the home page using your google ID, then click 'Add Workout' in the main navigation to be dircted to the workout input form. To add activities, click on the DETAILS link in the 'My Workouts' section, and scroll to the form to do so. Once you input the activity details, they will be added to the workout in a table. 

### Next Steps:

In the future, I plan to allow users to delete and edit individual activies, categorize their workouts based on date and muscle groups, and autofill previously-used activities within the 'Add Activity' form.
